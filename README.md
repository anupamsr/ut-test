UT Test

Website: https://github.com/ansrivastava/ut-test

This script checks the quality of unit test cases by doing injection testing.

UT Test takes a list of unit test cases and corresponding files to be tested
through an input file that mildly resembles YAML. Check 'ut_test_input' for
sample input format.

Clone and modify the tool, and submit patches!!!

This tool was originally written for eBay/PayPal Inc. while was working on
contract there, in Chennai. Due to unethical behaviour of PayPal staff, namely
Shahid Khan (Sr. Manager Innovation Programs in 2012, seated in San Jose) and
his underling Ramki Subramanian (MTS 2, Architect in 2012, seated in Chennai)
where they claimed that I had no right of acknowledgement on the work because
I was on contractor and thus inferior to ask for a certificate, and due to
political maneuvers that led me to lose 4500 USD, I have decided to release
this product under GNU GPL v 3, except that it CANNOT BE USED in ANY FORM in
PayPal Inc, eBay Inc, and all of its subsidiaries, and all of those who in
past have been or are in present involved with above mentioned people or
companies.
