UT Test
=======

Website: https://github.com/ansrivastava/ut-test

This script checks the quality of unit test cases by doing injection testing.

UT Test takes a list of unit test cases and corresponding files to be tested
through an input file that mildly resembles YAML. Check 'ut_test_input' for
sample input format.

Clone and modify the tool, and submit patches!!!

<pre>
This tool was originally written for eBay/PayPal Inc. Currently, the setup
script works only for that kind of home environment and will probably not run
for you without some modifications.

For eBay/PayPal Inc. employees, this tool should be run from the
buildtop.</pre>
