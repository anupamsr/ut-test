UT Test
=======

This script checks the quality of unit test cases by doing injection testing.

UT Test takes a list of unit test cases and corresponding files to be tested
through an input file that mildly resembles YAML. Check 'ut_test_input' for
sample input format.

This tool should be run from the buildtop.
